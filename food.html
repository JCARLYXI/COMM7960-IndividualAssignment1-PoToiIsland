        <p>There are just a few options for refuelling on Po Toi. Because the island used to rely heavily on seaweed production, a well-known dish that visitors should order is the Hong Kong diner classic of instant noodles with fried Spam and fried egg, but with the Po Toi twist of a healthy serving of briny seaweed in the broth.</p>

        <p>Island-famous restaurant Ming Kee Seafood will give you that fresh seafood experience that islands are known for. Given that a majority of restaurants are located at the centre of the island bay, diners will also get a great view of the ocean, and be able to keep an eye on the docks in case the ferry leaves without them!</p>
